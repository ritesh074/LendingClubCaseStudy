# Lending Club Case Study
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating 
personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. 
Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast 
online interface.
Like any other lending company, the success of the business is in 
successfully identifying the risk of lending before approving the loan 
using certain borrower related parameters that defines his/her behavior.
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the 
loan results in a loss of business to the company
2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to 
default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the 
company

PROBLEM STATEMENT
To identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced 
thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such 
applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or 
driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong 
indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its 
portfolio and risk assessment.

## Conclusions
1. Following variables are driving factors in loan defaults:
Grade, Interest Rate, Term, Home Ownership, Purpose, Year 
of approval
2. Grade – Higher the grade better the chance of successful 
closure of loans
3. Interest Rate – Loan with higher interest rates are ones 
with higher risk
4. Home ownership – Data shows that rented or mortgaged 
home ownership is directly related to loan defaults
5. Purpose – Small business tends to fail to repay the loans
6. Year of Approval – Lender got aggressive with passing 
years and the number of defaults also went up
